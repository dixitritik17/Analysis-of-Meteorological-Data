# Analysis-of-Meteorological-Data
This work delineates the Analysis of Meteorological Data (Finland’s Weather data) in order to test the Null Hypothesis. The analysis is supported by germane visualizations using Matplotlib library and several conclusions are drawn with the help of these visualizations.

## Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to test the Null Hypothesis H0 that states, “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming”.
The H0 means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period.
